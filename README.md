Assignment 4: Obsevational Studies and Applied ML 

This homework was done in a group of three students: Arnaud Garin, Reza Hosseini, Virginie Piskin

Distribution of Tasks:
- Reza: Task 1 - Boosting the economy by incentivizing self-employment 
- Virginie & Arnaud: Task 2 - All you need is loveâ€¦ And a dog!

The Task 2 on which I worked was a really good classification exercise in which I understood how to use a classifier in a specific context using different perfomance metrics.
